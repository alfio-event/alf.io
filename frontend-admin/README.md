# AlfioAdmin

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.10.

## Icons

1. Fetch svg icon here: https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Outlined
2. Put them in `src/assets/svg`
3. Run `npm run svg` to generate icon code
4. Import them in `shared/icons.ts`
5. Reference them with `<svg-icon key="key"></svg-icon>`

Note you may need to import the icon component + the list of icons if you are in a new module, see `app.module.ts` or 
`dashboard.module.ts`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
