# OpenShift deployment

[This blog post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/12/18/openshift-java-s2i-builder-java-11-grade/) (which [is also here](http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2018/11/s2i-with-java-11-gradle-builds-for.html)) explains the background about how to use S2I with Java 11 & Gradle on OpenShift.

## Your OpenShift instance

You'll either need to [locally install minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/index.html) from the OpenShift community edition OKD.io (great for testing! perhaps slightly increase resources from the default via `minishift config set memory 4096; minishift config set cpus 4`), or [use the Container Development Kit (CDK) from Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/) or [Get Started and Create a FREE ;-) Account on OpenShift.com Online](https://www.openshift.com), or [use an OpenShift Partner's cloud](https://www.openshift.com/learn/partners/).

## Obtain the OC CLI

Wherever your OpenShift cluster is, it's easiest to use the `oc` CLI Client tool to deploy Alf.io; it's available e.g. on [okd.io/download](https://www.okd.io/download.html).

## Deploy Alf.io on OpenShift using OC

Once you have `oc` available locally, and you have obtained an OpenShift Login Token from the Copy Login Command on the menu in the upper right corner under your name in the OpenShift Consoleâ€™s UI, you only have to do the following simple steps to deploy Alf.io:

    oc login https://... --token=...

    oc new-project alf-io

    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alfio-event/alf.io/1.x-maintenance/etc/OpenShift/openshift.yaml

    oc start-build alfio

    oc logs -f bc/alfio

    oc expose svc/alfio

    oc status

NB: This does NOT use the Docker images (below) from DockerHub, but instead builds a container from source using [OpenShift's S2I Java Builder feature](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/s2i/tree/master/java/examples), thanks to this project's configuration in [.s2i/](../../.s2i/), and uses [OpenShift's PostgreSQL](https://docs.okd.io/latest/using_images/db_images/postgresql.html) ([from here](https://github.com/sclorg/postgresql-container)).

## HTTPS Security

To use TLS on a Route with a custom Hostname, [use openshift-acme](https://github.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme/tree/master/deploy/letsencrypt-live/single-namespace) which will automagically add a Cert from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) as soon as you add the `metadata: annotations: kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` to your Route.

## Postgres database alternative

Instead of the containerized Postgres which the YAML (above) sets up on your OpenShift, you could also consider using an external managed Postgres as a Service, e.g. from https://www.elephantsql.com.  (You'll want to deploy your ElephantSQL instance as close as possible to your OpenShift cluster in order to reduce latency.)
