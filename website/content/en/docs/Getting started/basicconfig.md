  How to configure your alf.io instance on first start
---

## First setup guide

This is the basic configuration screen you'll see when you log in 
as admin for the first time.

#### General
The first option is to choose from the supported languages.
Then you need to enter the base application URL, which is the public URL of your instance.

#### E-Mail

The default option for the email configuration is disabled. You still
need to fill in 2 fields. These are how many e-mails should be managed
within 5 secs, and a reply-to address. These are fairly self-explanatory.


There are several options for managing emails. 
The first is a [SMTP server](./e-mail.md).
Then there is [mailgun.com](https://www.mailgun.com/) or 
[mailjet.com](https://www.mailjet.com/). Just select your desired
option and add the relevant details.



#### Map

Next is the map configuration. This is to show the location of events.
Again, the default here is none.
Alternatively, you can use either Google maps or Here maps.

Google maps requires a client API key. For more detail on how to get
an API key, click [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

HERE is an alternative map provider. For more detail on how to use HERE
click [here](https://developer.here.com/).


-----------------------------------------------

With all this done the basic configuration is now complete and you
can begin to use alf.io.
