  How to deploy alf.io on OpenShift

{{% pageinfo %}}
This tutorial refers to a version of Alf.io (1.x) which is now EOL. Please help us updating it!
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Your OpenShift instance

To get started, just [locally install minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/index.html) from the OpenShift community edition OKD.io - it's great for testing!  (You may want to slightly increase resources from the default via `minishift config set memory 4096; minishift config set cpus 4`.)

Alternatively, [use the Container Development Kit (CDK) from Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/) or [Get Started and Create a FREE ;-) Account on OpenShift.com Online](https://www.openshift.com), or [use an OpenShift Partner's cloud](https://www.openshift.com/learn/partners/).

## Obtain the OC CLI

Whatever your OpenShift cluster is, it's easiest to use the `oc` CLI Client tool to deploy Alf.io; it's available e.g. on [okd.io/download](https://www.okd.io/download.html).

## Deploy Alf.io on OpenShift using OC

Once you have `oc` locally available, and you have obtained an OpenShift Login Token from the Copy Login Command on the menu in the upper right corner under your name in the OpenShift Consoleâ€™s UI, you only have to do the following simple steps to deploy Alf.io:

    oc login https://... --token=...

    oc new-project alf-io

    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alfio-event/alf.io/1.x-maintenance/etc/OpenShift/openshift.yaml

    oc start-build alfio

    oc logs -f bc/alfio

When this Build (`bc`) is finished, the Deployment (`dc`) of a Pod with the Container will automatically start.
You'll then need to check its log to find the _generated admin credentials_ and get the URL via `oc status`.
When using Minishift it will be `...nip.io` so you'll open https://alfio-demo.192.168.42.145.nip.io/admin#/.

    oc logs dc/alfio

    oc status

NB: This uses [OpenShift's PostgreSQL](https://docs.okd.io/latest/using_images/db_images/postgresql.html) ([from here](https://github.com/sclorg/postgresql-container)), but does NOT use the Alf.io container images from DockerHub.  Instead it builds a container from source using [OpenShift's S2I Java Builder feature](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/s2i/tree/master/java/examples), thanks to this project's configuration in [.s2i/](../../.s2i/).  Check out [this blog post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/12/18/openshift-java-s2i-builder-java-11-grade/) (which [is also here](http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2018/11/s2i-with-java-11-gradle-builds-for.html)) to learn more about how to use S2I with Java 11 & Gradle on OpenShift.

## HTTPS Security

To use TLS on a Route with a custom Hostname, [use openshift-acme](https://github.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme/tree/master/deploy/letsencrypt-live/single-namespace) which will automagically add a Cert from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) as soon as you add the `metadata: annotations: kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` to your Route.

## Postgres database alternative

Instead of the containerized Postgres which the YAML (above) sets up on your OpenShift, you could also consider using an external managed Postgres as a Service, e.g. from https://www.elephantsql.com.  (You'll want to deploy your ElephantSQL instance as close as possible to your OpenShift cluster in order to reduce latency.)
